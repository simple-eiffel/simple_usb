				SIMPLE_USB - USB Device Access Library for Eiffel
		
				Provides USB device enumeration, HID device access, and gamepad support
				using Windows SetupAPI and HID API.
		
				Example:
					usb: SIMPLE_USB
					create usb.make
		
					-- List all USB devices
					across usb.devices as d loop
						print (d.product_name + " [" + d.vendor_id_hex + ":" + d.product_id_hex + "]%N")
					end
		
					-- Find specific device
					if attached usb.find_device (0x2341, 0x0043) as arduino then
						print ("Found Arduino: " + arduino.product_name + "%N")
					end
		
					-- Work with HID devices
					across usb.hid_devices as hid loop
						if hid.open then
							if attached hid.read_report as report then
								print ("Report: " + report.count.out + " bytes%N")
							end
							hid.close
						end
					end
